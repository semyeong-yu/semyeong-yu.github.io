# NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis

#### Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P.Srinivasan, Matthew Tancik

## Introduction

### Pipeline

1. march camera rays to generate a sampled set of 3D points

2. represents volumetric static scene by optimizing continuous 5D function(fully-connected network)

- input: single continuous `5D coordinate` ($$x, y, z, theta, phi$$)
- output:
  `volume density` (differential opacity) (how much radiance is accumulated by a ray)
  `view-dependent RGB color` (emitted radiance)

3. synthesizes novel view by classic `volume rendering` techniques(differentiable) to accumulate(project) the color/density samples into 2D image along rays

### Problem & Solution

Problem :

1. not sufficiently high-resolution representation
2. inefficient in the number of samples per camera ray

Solution :

1. input `positional encoding` for MLP to represent higher frequency function
2. `hierarchical sampling` to reduce the number of queries

### Contribution

1. represent continuous scenes as 5D neural radiance fields with basic MLP to render high-resolution novel views
2. differentiable volume rendering + hierarchical sampling
3. positional encoding to map input 5D coordinate into higher dim. space for high-frequency scene representation
4. overcome the storage costs of discretized voxel grids

limit : need GT 3D geometry

Images can be made zoomable.
Simply add `data-zoomable` to `<img>` tags that you want to make zoomable.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/8.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

The rest of the images in this post are all zoomable, arranged into different mini-galleries.
