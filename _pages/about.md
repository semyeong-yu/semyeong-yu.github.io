Hello!
I am a first-year M.S. student at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), advised by Prof. Munchurl Kim.  


I am interested in Computer Vision : Deep-Learning application within the field of Image and Video processing. My research areas include Super-Resolution, Video Motion Deblurring, Frame Interpolation, Depth Estimation, and Novel View Synthesis (Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting).  


Thank you for visiting my page.
